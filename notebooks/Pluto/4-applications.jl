Alice wants to send Bob two classical bits of information. That means, one of the four states `` 00, 01, 10 `` and `` 11 ``. How does she do this?
Lets say she achieves this by passing her qubits through one of the following gates, corresponding to the information she wants to send.

1. If she wants to send Bob `` 00 ``, then she'll send her qubit to Bob, as it is
2. If she wants to send Bob `` 01 ``, then she'll send her qubit to Bob, after passing it through X gate.
3. If she wants to send Bob `` 10 ``, then she'll send her qubit to Bob, after passing it through Z gate.

md"##### 2. Quantum Teleportation
Alice now has one more qubit, in the state `` a|0〉 + b|1〉.`` She wants to send her qubit to Bob, by changing the state of Bob's entangled qubit to Alice's extra qubit.

Confusing? Let's try naming the qubits. Alice and Bob have the qubits A and B respectively, which are entangled in the bell state. Alice has another qubit C. 

Alice wants to send her qubit to Bob by changing the state of B, to that of C. She wants the state of the qubit B to be `` a|0〉 + b|1〉. `` Alice doesn't know the values of a and b. Also, Bob can't make a measurement in any case as doing so will destroy B's state.

How does Alice do it? Well, she first passes both her qubits through the Reverse Bell circuit. She then measures both of her qubits. She gets one of the following outputs: `` |00〉, |01〉, |10〉 or |11〉, `` each with probability 1/4. Alice sends these two classical bits to Bob, via any classical means, example, she texts him or calls and tells him. Bob knows that corresponding to her message, there are 4 options, and he takes action accordingly for each.
1. He gets the message, `` |00〉, `` from Alice and knows that his qubit\(qubit B\) changed its state to that of qubit C.
2. He gets the message, `` |01〉, `` and knows that his qubit changed its state to `` a|1〉 + b|0〉, `` and he passes his qubit through X gate to change its state to that of qubit C.
3. He gets the message, `` |10〉, `` and knows that his qubit changed its state to `` a|0〉 - b|1〉, `` and he passes his qubit through Z gate to change its state to that of qubit C.
4. He gets the message, `` |11〉, `` and knows that his qubit changed its state to `` a|1〉 - b|0〉, `` and he passes his qubit through Y gate to change its state to that of qubit C."
